# Module 5 Challenge

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to better analyze weekly ride-sharing fares based on city-type. With this analysis, we can then recommend changes or considerations that the ride-sharing providers should make to maximize their profits. 

## Results

The analysis reveals a large amount of information- some of which is already to be expected. Primarily, it demonstrates that the majority of rides, as well as drivers, take place within the 'urban' city type. In fact, in the Urban section, there are significantly more drivers than rides. Because of this, the Urban type has the lowest fare per driver metric, coming out to about $16 per driver.

This rate dramatically increases for Suburban and Rural city types, each showing a fare per driver metric of $39 and $55 respectively. Clearly, a major discrepancy is within the fare amounts for an Urban city type, as opposed to Suburban and Rural. 

From the chart provided by the analysis, seen below, we can also draw several conclusions.

Primarily, we again see that the Urban city type is by far the most profitable region, with the most rides and drivers, and highest fare amounts overall. We also notice discrepanices in ride-sharing usage in different time windows- for example, march sees a dip for suburban and rural city types (likely due to the weather), while there are still bursts of higher fares in that window for Urban. Additionally, we can see a trend that looks to be an overall increase for Urban and Suburban corresponding to an increase in temperature/ spring months, and a spike for Rural use in early April- again, likely due to the advent of the spring and need for more materials for farming/agricultural use as the weather turns. 


## Summary and Recommendations

To address these disparities, there are 3 recommendations that we can make. The first is to work to lower the number of drivers within the Urban city type- this would greatly increase the profits of the individual drivers, and thereby the company. 
More drivers should be comitted to the Rural area, or potentially lower fares should be granted for that area, to encourage greater ride-sharing participation.
Finally, resources should be allocated strategically to maximize profits due to naturally occurring seasonal disparities- in March, more resources should be committed to urban areas, while more drivers should again be committed to rural regions at the start of spring.
